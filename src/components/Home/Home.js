                        Feeling at home is just as important as your degree. So, from offering modern, well-equipped student accommodation designed to fit a range of tastes and budgets, to giving you the support you need to find private sector housing, and offering you the chance to <a href="#" className='text-primary underline'>speak to current students,</a> weâ€™ll help make your transition to student living as seamless as possible.   </p>

                        Our student accommodation is organised by FXPlus - part of Falmouth University and our partners, the University of Exeter. It's spread across the Penryn campus and sites in Falmouth and Penryn towns; all connected by regular bus and train services. You can find out what's available and the number of spaces on the <a href="#">accommodation website.</a>
